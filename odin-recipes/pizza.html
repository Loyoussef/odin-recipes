    <h3>Recipes :</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps :</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 pie plates
        with non-stick cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook
        until beef is evenly browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and
        discard grease. Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried
        beans. Spread 1/2 of the seasoned ground beef over each one, and then
        cover with a second tortilla. Bake in the preheated oven until tortillas
        are crisp, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Then spread
        1/2 of the salsa over each top tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of
        the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of
        the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10
        more minutes. Let pizzas cool slightly before slicing each one into 4
        pieces.
      </li>
    </ol>
